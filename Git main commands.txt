Delete a branch

Git will not let you delete the branch you are currently on so you must make sure to checkout a branch that you are NOT deleting. SO: git checkout master (to get back to master branch)

// delete branch locally
git branch -d localBranchName

// delete branch remotely
git push origin --delete remoteBranchName
 
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D Branch_A'.

git branch -D Branch_A
Deleted branch Branch_A (was 3b3b8be).
